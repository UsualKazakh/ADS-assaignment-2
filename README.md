This project encompasses custom implementations of common data structures:

MyArrayList: A dynamic array-based list.
MyLinkedList: A doubly linked list.
MyStack: A stack based on MyArrayList.
MyQueue: A queue based on MyLinkedList.
MyMinHeap: A min-heap based on MyArrayList.
Each structure offers fundamental operations like addition, removal, peeking, and sizing.
